          What is a large amount of food?
        p.
          The amount of food may not be particularly meaningful when considering binge eating:
        ul
          li.first.
            Typical binges are often in the range of 2,000 to 5,000 calories#[sup 24]
          li.second.
            But whether any binge is objectively or subjectively defined as “large” may not matter because in either case the individual feels a loss of control and marked distress#[sup 25]
