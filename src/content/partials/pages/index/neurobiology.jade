    Emerging evidence of BED neurobiology

  .content-wrap
    h2.pretitle.
      While the cause of BED is unknown
    h1.
      Prevailing theories may support a neurobiological basis

    .reward
      h3.
        Reward center and impulsivity dysregulation
      p.
        Adults with BED have shown reduced activity in impulse control-related regions of the brain#[sup 7]

    .dysregulation
      h3.
        Neurotransmitter dysregulation
      p.
        Dopamine signaling converts sensory stimuli into processes that generate or enhance desire for a particular food#[sup 8-10]


    .endogenous
      h3.
        Endogenous μ-opioid signaling dysfunction
      p.
        μ-Opioid receptor polymorphisms are more often found in adults with BED#[sup 8]
      .blurb.
        Dysregulation in these areas of the brain, known as the reward center, has been associated with changes in reward processing, self-regulation, and impulse control that may play a significant role in abnormal, compulsive eating behavior.#[sup 7,8,11-17]

        Research also suggests that risk factors for BED include:

              BED appears to run in families

              Genetic differences in neurobiological components of the brain's reward center have been observed

              A nationally representative survey of 5,702 adults showed that the overwhelming majority of men and women with BED had experienced some form of trauma*
