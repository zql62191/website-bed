          What is binge eating disorder (BED)?
          
        </h2>
        <p>Binge eating disorder, now a distinct diagnosis in DSM-5<sup>®</sup>, is characterized by<sup>1</sup>:
          
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Recurring episodes (at least once weekly for 3 months) of consuming a large amount of food in a short period of time, compared with others</li>
          <li>A feeling of a lack of control over eating during an episode</li>
          <li>
            Marked distress regarding binge eating
            
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During a binge, adults with BED may eat much more rapidly than normal, eat until they are uncomfortably full, eat large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry, and/or eat alone out of embarrassment. They may feel disgusted with themselves, depressed, or very guilty afterward.
          
        </p>
        <p><em>These are not the complete diagnostic criteria, but instead a brief summary. Please view the full diagnostic criteria by selecting the link below. Diagnosis should be based on a complete evaluation of the patient.</em>

            <h1>Recognizing BED</h1>
            <p class="sub-head">BED is defined as recurring episodes of eating a large amount of food in a short period of time, with episodes characterized by feelings of lack of control and marked distress.<sup>1</sup></p>
            <p>
              These are not the full diagnostic criteria—see full DSM-5 criteria <a href="#" class="yellow">here</a>.
              
            </p>
            <h3>BED is different from bulimia nervosa</h3>
            <p>It is not associated with compensatory behaviors such as purging or excessive exercise, or with dietary restriction, although frequent dieting may be reported.<sup>1</sup></p>
            <h3>BED is different from overeating</h3>
            <p>While overeating is a challenge for many Americans, recurrent binge eating is much less common, far more severe, and is associated with significant physical and psychological problems.<sup>23</sup></p>
            <h3>BED is different from obesity</h3>
            <p>As noted in DSM-5, compared with weight-matched obese adults without BED, obese adults with BED consume more calories in laboratory studies of eating behavior and have<sup>1</sup>:</p>
