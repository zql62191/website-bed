// Helpers
@import "helpers/__helpers.scss";
// The helpers/ folder (sometimes called utils/) gathers all Sass tools and helpers we’ll use
// across the project. Got a function? A mixin? Put it in there. This folder also contains
// a _variables.scss file (sometimes _config.scss) which holds all global variables for the
// project (for typography, color schemes, and so on).

// Base
@import "base/__base.scss";
// The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate stuff for your project.
// In there, you might find the reset (or Normalize.css, or whatever), probably some
// stuff dealing with typography, and, depending on the project, maybe some other files.

// Components
@import "components/__components.scss";
// For smaller components, there is the components/ folder (frequently called modules/).
// While layout/ is kind of macro (defining the global wireframe), components/ is more micro.
// It can contain all kinds of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, or anything
// along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/ since your site is should
// be mostly composed of tiny modules.

// Layout
@import "layout/__layout.scss";
// The layout/ directory (sometimes called partials/) usually contains a number of files,
// each of them setting some styles for the main sections of the layout (header, footer,
// and so on). It also contains the _grid file which is the grid system used to build
// the layout.

// Pages
@import "pages/__pages.scss";
// If you have page-specific styles, I think it’s cool to put them in a pages/ folder and in a file
// named after the page. For example, it’s not uncommon to have very specific styles for the home page,
// so you’d have a _home.scss file in pages/ dealing with this.

// Views
@import "views/__views.scss";
// View specific styles (since we are doing angular views)

// Vendors
@import "vendor/__vendor.scss";
// And last but not least, you will probably have a vendors/ folder containing all the CSS files from external
// libraries and frameworks – Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those
// aside in the same folder is a good way to tell “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.

// Shame
/* SHAME START */
@import "_shame.scss";
/* SHAME END */
// The idea of shame is that you have a totally new stylesheet reserved just for your hacky code.
// The code you have to write to get the release out on time, but the code that makes you ashamed.
 

// .ribbon {
//     @include ribbon();
// }
