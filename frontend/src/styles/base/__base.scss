// Base

// The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate stuff for your project.
// In there, you might find the reset (or Normalize.css, or whatever), probably some
// stuff dealing with typography, and, depending on the project, maybe some other files.

@import "_reset.scss";        // reset
@import "_angular.scss";      // angular
@import "_project.scss";      // project
@import "_typography.scss";
