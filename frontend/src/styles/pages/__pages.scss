// Pages

// If you have page-specific styles, I think it’s cool to put them in a pages/ folder and in a file
// named after the page. For example, it’s not uncommon to have very specific styles for the home page,
// so you’d have a _home.scss file in pages/ dealing with this.

@import "_index.scss";
