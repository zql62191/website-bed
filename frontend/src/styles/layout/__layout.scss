// Layout

// The layout/ directory (sometimes called partials/) usually contains a number of files,
// each of them setting some styles for the main sections of the layout (header, footer,
// and so on). It also contains the _grid file which is the grid system used to build
// the layout.

@import "_header--global.scss";
@import "_footer--global.scss";
