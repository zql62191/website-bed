// And last but not least, you will probably have a vendors/ folder containing all the CSS files from external
// libraries and frameworks – Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those
// aside in the same folder is a good way to tell “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.
