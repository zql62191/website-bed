    h2 What is binge eating#[br]disorder (B.E.D.)?

    p B.E.D., now a distinct disorder, is&nbsp;defined as recurring episodes (â‰¥&nbsp;once weekly, for at least 3 months)&nbsp;of consuming a large amount of food in a short time, compared with others. Patients feel a lack of control during a binge and&nbsp;marked distress over their binge eating.&nbsp;They typically experience shame&nbsp;and guilt, among other symptoms,&nbsp;about their bingeing. Compensatory behaviors are not observed like those associated with bulimia nervosa.#[sup 1]
