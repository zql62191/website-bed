      While the cause of BED is unknown

      Prevailing theories may support a neurobiological basis

        Reward center and impulsivity dysregulation
      p.
        Adults with BED have shown reduced activity #[br.hide--mobile]in impulse control-related regions of the brain#[sup 7]

    .dysregulation.neuro-graphic
      h3.
        Neurotransmitter dysregulation
      p.
        Dopamine signaling converts sensory stimuli #[br.hide--mobile]into processes that generate or enhance desire #[br.hide--mobile]for a particular food#[sup 8-10]

        Endogenous μ-opioid signaling dysfunction
      p.
        μ-Opioid receptor polymorphisms are more #[br.hide--mobile]often found in adults with BED#[sup 8]

        Dysregulation in these areas of the brain, known as the reward center, has been associated with changes in reward processing, self-regulation, and impulse control that may play a significant role in abnormal, compulsive eating behavior.#[sup 7,8,11-17]

        Research also suggests that risk factors for BED include:

              A nationally representative survey of 5,702 adults #[br.hide--mobile]showed that the overwhelming majority of men #[br.hide--mobile]and women with BED had experienced some #[br.hide--mobile]form of trauma*
